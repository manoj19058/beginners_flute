# Beginner's Flute

## Overview

The "Beginner's Flute" project is an innovative self-learning interface designed to simplify the learning process for wind instruments, particularly the flute. It addresses the common challenges of finding skilled instructors and the high costs associated with music lessons. The device offers an interactive learning experience with tutorials and games that teach the basics of flute playing, improving both hand coordination and lung capacity for proper air blowing.

## Key Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes light-dependent resistors (LDRs) to detect and assess the correctness of the user's finger placements over the flute holes.
- **Interactive Learning:** Features a gaming interface where balls fall on the screen, indicating which holes to cover, making the learning process engaging.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The system provides immediate feedback with a scoring mechanism to track progress and correct mistakes.
- **Portable and Wireless:** The device is lightweight, portable, and incorporates wireless technology using Bluetooth, enhancing user convenience.
- **Scalable Design:** The concept can be extended to other wind instruments like the saxophone, clarinet, and oboe, broadening its impact on the music education industry.

## Project Components

1. **Hardware:**
    - Modified bamboo flute with LDRs placed below each hole.
    - MEMS microphone to detect air blowing.
    - Arduino Nano for processing and data communication.
    - Bluetooth module for wireless connectivity.

2. **Software:**
    - Processing software for creating interactive tutorials and games.
    - Arduino IDE for programming the microcontroller.
